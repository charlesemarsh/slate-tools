## Getting started

Add `theme-lint` as a devDependency to a Shopify theme by running the following command inside of the theme directory:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @shopify/theme-lint
```

Add a new NPM script to your theme's `package.json` like so:

```js
"scripts": {
  "lint": "theme-lint ./dist"
}
```

Finally, run `npm run lint` to run the translation tests.
